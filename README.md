## About the CSV File

This tool is designed to process CSV files downloaded from **ING Bank** online banking. The CSV must have semicolon (`;`) separators and come from your **payment account** (Dutch: *Betaalrekening*).

To download the CSV from **ING Bank**, log in to your online banking portal and navigate to:

- **"Afschriften en overzichten"** (Statements and overviews)  
- Then **"Af- en bijschrijvingen downloaden"** (Download debit and credit transactions)  

When prompted, **select your Betaalrekening (payment account)** as the account to download. You can choose the largest time span available to analyze a comprehensive dataset.

Please note that **ING Bank's online environment may change over time**, so exact menu names or navigation steps could differ slightly. The instructions above are a guideline.

## Compatibility and Contributions

While this tool is specifically tested with **ING Bank** CSV exports, it *may* work with CSV files from other banks if they use similar formatting and column names. However, this is **untested**.

If you encounter any issues or want to support additional banks or CSV formats, please feel free to:

- Open an **issue** describing the problem or feature request  
- Submit a **pull request** with improvements or fixes  

This project is open-source and welcomes community contributions!
